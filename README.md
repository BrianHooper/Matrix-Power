# Matrix-Power
C++ Library for calculating the power of a square matrix

# Build
To compile, envoke the command 'make' from the src/ directory.

# Run
To execute the program, use the following command:
```
./hooper_lab1 <inputfile> <outputfile>
```

where <inputfile> is a path to a file containing comma-separated input values. 
An example input file is given in example_input.txt. 
If the file designated by <outputfile> already exists,
results will be appended to the end of the file. Otherwise, it will be created. 

The bash script 'Execute.sh' runs the program using the src/input.txt and src/output.txt
and formats the output for readability
